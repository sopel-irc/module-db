Users can bomb each other with `.bomb`. When bombed, `.cutwire <color>` to try and defuse it. But if you guess wrong, you're dead! BOOM! If your attacker is nice, they'll `.bombcancel` youâ€¦ maybe.

Also comes with opt-out (`.bomboff`/`.bombon`) and per-channel controls for ops, along with other convenience functions for ops/admins.
