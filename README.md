# plugin-db
A simple site to list user-submitted Sopel plugins. Concept/WIP phase.

## Preview
The `prototype` branch is running on Netlify: https://sopel-moddb-prototype.netlify.com/

Prototype pages may be full of dummy data. They might move or disappear as the site
evolves. Who knows? Experimentation is the name of the game for now.
